I designed handheld standard calculator for double data type. 
I followed Model View Controller design pattern for this application.
Arithmatic exceptions,different input scenarios are handled in app.
Additional functionality where input gets cleared when user shakes phone is implemented.
Application is tested for various arithmatic scenarios on simulator,UI tests and unit tests added for the same. 
The screenshots of calculator are shared at:
